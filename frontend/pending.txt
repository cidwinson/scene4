> solve the state management problem, in frontend /projects whenever a View Details of a particular project      
  is clicked, currently it route to /breakdown?projectId=api-projectid 

  once this is loaded, it should persist using the project id in /budget without the need to click on drop       ──╮
  down and confirm. 

*note that if user did not route through the view details of a particular projectid, it should load the default project in /budget

  Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Examine current routing and state management in frontend
     ☐ Check how project ID is handled in breakdown view
     ☐ Examine budget view and dropdown logic
     ☐ Implement project ID persistence in state management
     ☐ Update budget view to use persisted project ID



chatbot system prompt shouldnt be restrictive but answer should be kept to context of individual projectid's related query.
